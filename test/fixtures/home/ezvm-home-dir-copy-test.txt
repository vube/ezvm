If you've found this in your home directory and you are wondering why,
it's probably because you ran the ezvm end2end test.  That test copies
this file to your home directory as part of its procedure.

This is just a test file to ensure that the copy-home-dir.sh lib is
actually putting this in your home dir.  You can safely delete it.
