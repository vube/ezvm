       ezvm exec [-d /dir] [-q] [-T] [-V x] -F update_filename_egrep_expression
       ezvm exec -h

    update_filename should be the name of a file in your local update directory.

    update_filename_egrep_expression is an expression to pass to egrep, any update
    file with a name matching the expression will be executed.

    -d      Override the local content dir. Default: $EZVM_BASE_DIR/etc/local
    -h      Print this help screen.
    -q      Quiet.  Don't print status updates and diagnostic info.  Sets verbosity level = 0.
    -T      Test mode.  Don't actually exec, just show us what would have been executed.
    -V x    Set verbosity level to x.  Higher verbosity levels result in more output, mainly
            good for debugging.  Default: 1
